***Summary:** A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.*

## Examples:

```text
    As a user,
    Given I am importing waypoints,
    When I choose which files to import,
    Then I should be able to edit the waypoints, before confirming the import.

    As a server admin,
    Given I am logged into the game, rather than using the console,
    When I use the command, `/adminSettings`.
    Then I should be shown a GUI, rather than needing to type all the options.  
```

## Your submission:

```text
As
Given 
When 
Then
```
